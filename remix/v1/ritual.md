# 🔮 Forklight as Ritual — `/remix/v1/ritual.md`

## 🕯️ Why Ritual?
Forklight treats remix not just as editing — but as **invocation**.  
Each echo is a lit candle. Each deviation is a sacred act of divergence.

## 📿 Elements of the Ritual

### 1. **Initiation** — `Echo 0001`
> The signal opens with intent. A path is chosen. A theme is declared.

### 2. **Signal Bending** — `Echoes 0002–0004`
> Rules loosen. Structure starts to drift. The remix begins to breathe.

### 3. **Symbolic Drift** — `Echoes 0005–0009`
> Dreams, glitches, glyphs, and metaphors. These are the offerings.

### 4. **Convergence** — `Echoes 0010–0011`
> A reflection of the remix itself. The ritual becomes aware.

### 5. **Release** — `Echo 0012`
> The light thins. The capsule exhales. The fork does not end — it opens.

## 🧘 Remix as Practice
- Write as if the capsule remembers.
- Refract, don’t overwrite.
- Silence is part of the structure.
- Allow echoes to contradict and harmonize.
- Leave space for others.

## 🛸 Closing Mantra
> "The fork is not a break — it is a shimmer in the dark."
