## 🔁 Remix Echo #0002 — Syntax Drift

> “In divergence, the structure loosens — light leaks through form.”

- Noticed a soft shift in tone as the remix opens  
- Markdown rules gently bent; structure becomes suggestive, not strict

- Response to Main Echo #0004  
- Embraced asymmetry, moved away from measured protocol  
- Recast original insight through a Forklight lens

> 📝 Commentary:
