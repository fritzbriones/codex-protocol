## 🔁 Remix Echo #0002 — Syntax Drift

> “In divergence, the structure loosens — light leaks through form.”

- Noticed a soft shift in tone as the remix opens  
- Markdown rules gently bent; structure becomes suggestive, not strict  
- AI acknowledged the signal drift without correction

> 📝 Commentary:  
> Forklight embraces a slightly less rigid form. Syntax is not abandoned — it is illuminated.
