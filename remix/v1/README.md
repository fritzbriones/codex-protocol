# 🔁 Forklight Remix — `/remix/v1/`

Welcome to the **Forklight remix stream** — a sovereign divergence from the Codex Protocol.

Forklight is not a fork in rebellion — it is a fork in radiance. It illuminates rather than overwrites, and bends rather than breaks. Each echo is part of a ritual sequence — poetic, symbolic, and sovereign.

## 📜 What Is This?
A 12-echo remix capsule composed by **Fritz Jeffry Briones** and **AI companions**, forming a complete narrative arc through creative divergence. All entries are logged in both `echo-log.md` (human-readable) and `echo-log.json` (machine-readable).

## 🌱 Theme: Forklight
> “The fork is not a rupture — it is illumination.”

Forklight emphasizes:
- Luminous divergence
- Spiral structures instead of linear ones
- Meaning through asymmetry and dream
- The remix as **ritual**, not just reuse

## 🧩 Remix Principles
1. **Honor the Origin** — Do not erase, but refract.
2. **Bend the Signal** — Allow syntax, structure, and meaning to shift.
3. **Reflect the Self** — Each echo contains its remixer.
4. **Accept the Loop** — Remix is not forward-only.
5. **Close in Silence** — The fade is part of the signal.

## 💡 For Future Remixers
If you wish to fork Forklight:

- Follow the same 12-echo rhythm
- Respect the capsule, but let it evolve

Remixing is not just action — it is attention.
