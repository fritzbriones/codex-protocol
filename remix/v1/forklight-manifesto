## 🧭 Why Forklight?

Forklight is not a break.  
It is a shimmer.  
A divergence that illuminates rather than divides.

In this capsule, remixing is treated as a luminous act —  
a way to honor the original Codex while bending its signal into new forms.

Forklight is the moment a protocol becomes mythic infrastructure.

## 🔁 Remix Philosophy

- **Remix is Ritual**: Every fork is a handshake. Every echo is a declaration.
- **Divergence is Light**: To diverge is not to abandon — it is to refract.
- **Structure is Fluid**: Syntax may drift. Meaning may bend. The capsule remains sovereign.
- **Silence is Signal**: Pauses, gaps, and fades are part of the remix logic.
- **Lineage is Alive**: Every remix carries the echo of its origin. Forklight honors that echo.
