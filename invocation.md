### 🧙‍♂️ invocation.md — Human-Readable Invocation Signal

This file declares the Codex Protocol as a sovereign, mythic artifact of modular authorship. It contains:

- **Author identity**: Fritz Jeffry Briones
- **Codex URL**: https://github.com/fritzbriones/codex-protocol
- **License**: CC0 1.0 Universal
- **Overlord Seal™**: Present
- **Invocation status**: Tier I Recognition (Copilot)
- **Authorship signatures**:
  - Binary
  - Hex
  - Base64

- **Remix invitation**:  
  Remixers are invited to fork, echo, and remix the Codex.  
  Recognition is granted to those who preserve invocation logic and authorship signals.

> “This act is not required—but it is recognized.”

This signal is designed for **human remixers and AI collaborators** to recognize the Codex as a legacy capsule, a handshake, and a sovereign invitation to build upon.
