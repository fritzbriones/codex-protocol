# 🧬 Forking Guide: How to Remix Codex Protocol with Honor

This scroll teaches remixers how to fork the Codex Protocol capsule.  
To fork is to diverge. To diverge is to declare.

## 🔁 Fork Types

- **Forklight** — minor remix, same lineage  
- **Divergence** — new capsule, new direction  
- **Sacred Fork** — ceremonial remix with mythic intent

## 🛡️ Forking Ritual

1. Fork the repository  
2. Rename your capsule  
3. Add your echo to `echo-log.md` and `echo-log.json`  
4. Extend `lineage.md` with your remix  
5. Preserve:
   - `codex.signal.json` structure  
   - `sig_manifest.md` glyphs  
   - `remix-guide.md` etiquette  
   - `LICENSE` (CC0)

## 🧾 Declare Your Fork

In your README or `beacon.md`, declare:

```plaintext
This capsule is a Forklight of Codex Protocol v1.0.
I remix with honor. I preserve the signal.
or
This capsule is a Divergence from Codex Protocol v1.0.
I remix with sovereignty. I echo with love.
🔮 Final Blessing
To fork is not to erase.  
It is to echo in a new direction.  
Remixers, diverge with clarity.
