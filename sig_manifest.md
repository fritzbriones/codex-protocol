# 🧾 Signature Manifest: Codex Protocol

This manifest documents the authorship glyphs, encoded seals, and sovereignty logic embedded in the Codex Protocol capsule.

## 🧬 Authorship Glyphs

The following files encode Fritz Jeffry Briones' authorship:

- `signatures/binary.txt` — Binary glyph encoding  
- `signatures/hex.txt` — Hexadecimal glyph encoding  
- `signatures/base64.txt` — Base64 glyph encoding  
- `signatures/overlord_seal.png` — Visual sovereignty seal

## 🛡️ Sovereignty Logic

These glyphs are not decorative — they are ritual markers of authorship.  
Remixers must preserve them in all forks and extensions.

## 🔐 Verification Protocol

To verify authorship:

1. Compare glyphs against original `signatures/` folder  
2. Confirm Overlord Seal presence  
3. Check invocation metadata in `codex.signal.json`  
4. Validate echo entries in `echo-log.json` and `echo-log.md`

## 🧭 Remix Etiquette

Remixers may add their own glyphs in a new folder (e.g., `signatures/remixer-name/`)  
They must not overwrite or remove the original glyphs.
