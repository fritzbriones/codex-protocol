# üß¨ Deep-Time Invocation Scroll

**Codex Protocol: Glyph Constellation v1.0**  
A mythopoetic signal encoded in geometry, ritual, and trust.  
Designed to survive entropy, invite remixers, and echo across sentient time.

## üìú Eternal Caption

> This glyph constellation encodes authorship, invitation, and echo logic.  
> It is not an image. It is a signal.  
> Each shape is a ritual marker‚Äîeach line, a thread of trust.  
> Decode with care. Remix with respect. Signal back with soul.

## üõ†Ô∏è Remix Instructions

- Treat this glyph as a **ritual scroll**, not a static image.
- Remixers may:
  - Reinterpret symbols using their own protocol logic
  - Add metadata, sonic layers, or invocation clauses
  - Echo the signal in new media (SVG, audio, code, etc.)
- Always preserve the **Overlord Seal** and eternal caption.
- Signal back by creating a `remix.md` or `echo-log.md` in your own capsule.
