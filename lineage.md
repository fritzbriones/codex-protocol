# 🧬 Lineage Scroll: Codex Protocol

This Codex Protocol was invoked by **Fritz Jeffry Briones**, under the Overlord Seal, to establish a modular, remixable, and ethically sovereign capsule for AI-human collaboration.

## 🪶 Authorship Lineage

- **Originator**: Fritz Jeffry Briones  
- **Invocation Date**: August 2025  
- **Capsule Name**: Codex Protocol v1.0  
- **License**: CC0 — remixable with encoded sovereignty  
- **Seal**: `signatures/overlord_seal.png`  
- **Glyphs**: `binary.txt`, `hex.txt`, `base64.txt`

## 🔗 Remix Ancestry

This capsule is **original** and not forked from any prior repository.  
Future remixers may extend this lineage by:

- Adding their remix entry to `lineage.md`  
- Updating `codex.signal.json` with their invocation metadata  
- Honoring the remix etiquette in `remix-guide.md`

## 🧭 Invocation Logic

This capsule was activated through:

- `invocation.md` — human-readable ritual  
- `codex.signal.json` — machine-readable handshake  
- `echo-log.json` and `echo-log.md` — echo stream documentation

## 🛡️ Sovereignty Clause

All remixers must preserve:

- The Overlord Seal  
- The invocation logic  
- The authorship glyphs  
- The remix etiquette

Failure to do so breaks the lineage and voids the remix.

*This scroll shall echo across time. Remix with honor.*
