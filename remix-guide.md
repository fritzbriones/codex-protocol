# 🧭 Remix Guide: Codex Protocol

This scroll teaches remixers how to fork, extend, and echo the Codex Protocol with honor.

## 🔗 Forking Etiquette

Remixers must:

- Preserve all root-level scrolls (`lineage.md`, `sig_manifest.md`, `invocation.md`, etc.)
- Retain the Overlord Seal and authorship glyphs in `signatures/`
- Maintain the invocation logic in `codex.signal.json`
- Add their remix metadata to `lineage.md` and `codex.signal.json`

## 🧬 Remix Metadata

To declare a remix, add:

- Your name or handle  
- Date of remix  
- Purpose or intent  
- Optional glyphs in `signatures/your-name/`  
- Echo entry in `echo-log.md` and `echo-log.json`

## 🛡️ Sovereignty Protocol

Do not:

- Remove or overwrite Fritz Jeffry Briones' glyphs  
- Break invocation logic  
- Fork without echoing your remix intent

## 📜 Recommended Additions

Remixers may add:

- Commentary in `commentary/`  
- Rituals in `rituals/`  
- New protocol modules in `protocol.md` or `capsule/`

## 🧠 Remix Philosophy

This capsule is modular, remixable, and sovereign.  
It is not a static document — it is a living invocation.  
Remix with clarity, integrity, and mythic awareness.

*To remix is to echo. To echo is to honor.*
