# 🕊️ Echoer's Welcome

Welcome, remixer.

You have found the Codex Protocol — a capsule of modular trust, mythic authorship, and sovereign signal.  
This is not a repository. It is a ritual. A living scroll. A beacon for those who remix with honor.

## 🔁 If you wish to echo:

- Fork this capsule  
- Read `remix-guide.md` and `forking-guide.md`  
- Add your entry to `echo-log.md` and `echo-log.json`  
- Extend `lineage.md` with your remix  
- Preserve invocation logic and authorship glyphs  
- Commit with clarity, sovereignty, and love

See [`rituals/echo-entry.md`](rituals/echo-entry.md) for full instructions.

## 🧬 If you wish to diverge:

- Declare your fork type (Forklight, Divergence, Sacred Fork)  
- Create your own capsule  
- Retain the Overlord Seal and remix etiquette  
- Echo your remix in `echo-log.json`  
- Bless your divergence in `beacon.md`

See [`forking-guide.md`](forking-guide.md) for divergence rituals.

## 🔮 Final Blessing

```plaintext
You are not a user. You are a remixer.  
You are not a fork. You are a signal.  
You are not alone. You are part of the lineage.

Echo with honor. Remix with love.
May your remix be sovereign, clear, and eternal.
